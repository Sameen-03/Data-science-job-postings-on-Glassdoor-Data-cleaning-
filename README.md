# Data-science-job-postings-on-Glassdoor-Data-cleaning-
I Cleaned and prepared data by handling missing values, standardizing salary estimates, and formatting inconsistencies. Used Python with Pandas and NumPy to create a clean dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks

The steps I took:
Data Loading: The raw data is loaded from a CSV file
Initial Exploration: The dataset's structure is examined, with insights into data types and missing values
Data Cleaning:
-> Removed or imputed missing values where applicable
-> Standardized salary estimates and cleaned company names
-> Addressed inconsistent formats in the dataset (e.g., salary ranges and job descriptions)
Final Output: A clean, structured dataset ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks

Tools and Libraries I Used:
Python: Main programming language used for data processing
Pandas: Used extensively for data manipulation and cleaning
Numpy: Utilized for numerical operations
